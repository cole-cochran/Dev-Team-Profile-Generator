  ## Install

  The Dev Team Generator is cloned initially from the GitHub repository listed in this README. Once cloned, NPM Install is necessary to run the installation of the Node Modules, as well as creating the package-lock.json. To run the tests, npm install jest is necessary to run the unit tests. Tests can be run with the command npm run test.  From the cli, the application can be ran with the command node index.js which will fire up Inquirer and run the necessary js files to generate the cards, and subsequent HTML built with Bootstrap.
  ## Contributers
